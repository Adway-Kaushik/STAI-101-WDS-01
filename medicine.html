        genetic diseases. CRISPR's value lies in its simplicity, efficiency, and broad applications, from genetic
        disorders, cancer to drought-resistant crops.</h2>

    <h1 class="heading">Mechanism of CRISPR</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">The CRISPR system is a defense mechanism used by bacteria and archaea against viruses. It
        employs Cas nucleases to cut DNA, creating a memory of viral attacks. When the same virus strikes again, Cas9,
        guided by <a href="important-terms.html"
            title="Guide RNA (gRNA): a type of RNA molecule that binds to Cas9 and specifies, based on the sequence of the gRNA, the location at which Cas9 will cut DNA">gRNA</a>
        , cuts the virus's DNA at a specific location. Scientists Doudna and Charpentier harnessed this
        system for gene editing. They adapted it to cut DNA at desired places by modifying gRNA, enabling gene
        deactivation or insertion. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is a game-changing tool that cuts DNA strands and exploits
        cell repair mechanisms. Two repair methods follow: messy non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), causing small DNA
        changes, and precise homology-directed repair (HDR), inserting new DNA. HDR's success rate is lower, but
        researchers are enhancing efficiency through timing and treatments. This technology holds promise for drug
        development and disease understanding.

    <h1 class="heading">How has CRISPR helped?</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">CRISPR-based tests can diagnose illnesses, including viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and diseases like
        cancer. They offer cost-effective and simple diagnostic solutions. Additionally, CRISPR technology has
        facilitated the creation of complex antibiotics through gene editing. This holds promise in addressing
        antimicrobial resistance and treating neglected diseases, enhancing healthcare solutions.

    <h1 class="heading">How did Genetic Engineering help in Healthcare?</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">Genetic engineering has revolutionized medicine by enabling the production of therapeutic
        substances like hormones, immune proteins, and blood-clotting factors. Before genetic engineering, substances
        were harvested from cadavers or donor animals, risking allergies and infections. However, using human DNA to
        create proteins reduced these risks.</h2>

        technique has been extended to create growth hormones, <a href="important-terms.html"
