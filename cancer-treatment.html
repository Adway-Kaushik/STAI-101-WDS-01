    <h1 class="heading">CRISPR in Cancer</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">CRISPR-Cas9 technology is extremely valuable for cancer research due to its precision in
        editing genes. It helps researchers identify genes that drive cancer, validate drug targets, model cancer
        mutations, study drug resistance, and even explore personalized treatment strategies. By mimicking
        patient-specific genetic alterations, CRISPR aids in testing tailored therapies. Additionally, CRISPR holds
        promise for developing gene therapies that directly target and correct cancer-related genetic mutations,
        offering new avenues for treatment.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subwrite">The challenges in treating cancer arise from its genetic complexity and the diverse tumor
        microenvironment. Cancer's unique genetic mutations drive its growth, and the complex interactions within tumors
        and the immune system make it difficult to develop a universal cure. Cellular immunotherapies like TIL, TCR, and
        CAR-T have emerged as promising approaches, targeting cancer cells with modified immune cells.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subwrite"><a href="important-terms.html" title="TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte) therapy is a type of cellular immunotherapy that has been used to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, lung cancer, genitourinary cancers and a growing list of other malignancies.
        ">TIL</a> therapy involves extracting immune cells from tumors, expanding them, and re-infusing them
        to attack cancer. However, its efficacy has limitations, leading to the development of TCR therapy. <a href="important-terms.html"
            title="Like CAR T-cell therapy, engineered T cell receptor therapy involves treating cancer with activated T lymphocytes from the body. Both strategies attach new receptors to the cells' surfaces, enabling them to attack different forms of cancer.
        ">TCR</a> therapy
        modifies T cells with specific receptors to enhance cancer recognition. Yet, TCR therapy faces challenges due to
        cancer cell evasion and immune-related adverse effects.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        CRISPR technology has revolutionized these therapies. It can enhance TILs by disrupting inhibitory genes,
        increasing their aggressiveness. For TCR therapy, CRISPR can improve specificity and safety by controlling TCR
        expression and eliminating endogenous TCRs. CAR-T therapy, which introduces synthetic receptors into T cells,
        overcomes <a href="important-terms.html"
            title="MHC restriction in T cells occurs during their development in the thymus, specifically positive selection">MHC</a>
        limitations. CRISPR further enhances CAR-T by optimizing gene expression, increasing cancer cell
        killing, and creating "off-the-shelf" CAR-T cells.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subwrite"> <a href="important-terms.html"
            title="Natural killer cells (NK cells) are white blood cells that destroy infected and diseased cells, like cancer cells. They're also a type of lymphocyte, like B-cells and T-cells. NK cells can destroy harmful cells in the early stages, preventing viruses and cancer cells from spreading.">NK

        , part of the innate immune system, have potential for cancer therapy. CRISPR editing
        can enhance NK cell targeting and persistence, and even allow them to express <a href="important-terms.html"

        , combining innate and
        adaptive immunity.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        CRISPR technology is not limited to cell therapies. It can be employed in vivo to directly target cancer genes,
        preventing their growth. Newly discovered CRISPR systems offer novel avenues, such as using Cas3 to delete tumor
        survival genes. CRISPR-based <a href="important-terms.html" title="The term epigenome is derived from the Greek word epi which literally means above the genome. The
            epigenome consists of chemical compounds that modify, or mark, the genome in a way that tells it what to do,
            where to do it, and when to do it.">epigenome</a> editing can also alter gene expression associated with
        cancer.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        The field of CRISPR cancer therapy is rapidly evolving, with ongoing clinical trials and promising results.
        Gene-edited T cell therapies are advancing, and partnerships between companies like CRISPR Therapeutics and
        Nkarta are developing innovative approaches. Resources like the Innovative Genomics Institute and CRISPR
        Medicine News keep us updated on this dynamic landscape.
