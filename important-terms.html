    <h1 class="heading">CRISPR:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats of genetic information that some bacterial
        species use as part of an antiviral system
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        The molecule that most organisms use to store genetic information, which contains
        the “instructions for life”
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Nucleases:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        Enzymes that degrade nucleic acids, either DNA or RNA. DNases degrade DNA and RNases degrade RNA
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Cas9:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        A CRISPR-associated (Cas) endonuclease, or enzyme, that acts as “molecular scissors” to cut DNA at a
        location specified by a guide RNA
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Ribonucleic acid (RNA):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        A molecule related to DNA that living things use for a number of purposes, including
        transporting and reading the DNA “instructions”
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Guide RNA (gRNA):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        A type of RNA molecule that binds to Cas9 and specifies, based on the sequence of the gRNA,
        the location at which Cas9 will cut DNA
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        A pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as
        "non-homologous" because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template, in
        contrast to homology directed repair (HDR), which requires a homologous sequence to guide repair.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Homology-directed repair (HDR):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        A process where a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is repaired by homologous
        recombination using a DNA template.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Plasmid:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        A small circular DNA molecule found in bacteria and some other microscopic organisms. Plasmids are
        physically separate from chromosomal DNA and replicate independently.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        Therapy is a type of cellular immunotherapy that has been used to treat
        head
        and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, lung cancer, genitourinary cancers and a growing list of other
        malignancies.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">TCR:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        Like CAR T-cell therapy, engineered T cell receptor therapy involves treating cancer with activated T
        lymphocytes from the body. Both strategies attach new receptors to the cells' surfaces, enabling them to attack
        different forms of cancer.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">MHC:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        A restriction in T cells occurs during their development in the thymus, specifically positive selection
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Natural killer cells (NK cells):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        These are white blood cells that destroy infected and diseased cells, like cancer
        cells. They're also a type of lymphocyte, like B-cells and T-cells. NK cells can destroy harmful cells in the
        early stages, preventing viruses and cancer cells from spreading.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        In CAR T-cell therapies, T cells are taken from the patient's blood and are changed in the lab by adding a gene
        for a receptor (called a chimeric antigen receptor or CAR), which helps the T cells attach to a specific cancer
        cell antigen.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Epigenome:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        The term epigenome is derived from the Greek word epi which literally means "above" the genome. The
        epigenome
        consists of chemical compounds that modify, or mark, the genome in a way that tells it what to do, where to do
        it, and when to do it.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Parathyroid hormone:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        also called parathormone or parathyrin, is a peptide hormone secreted by the parathyroid
        glands that regulates the serum calcium concentration through its effects on bone, kidney, and intestine
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Interferons:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        These are proteins that are part of your natural defenses. They tell your immune system that germs
        or
        cancer cells are in your body. And they trigger killer immune cells to fight those invaders. Interferons got
        their name because they "interfere" with viruses and keep them from multiplying.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Cytokines:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        These are small proteins that are crucial in controlling the growth and activity of other immune
        system
        cells and blood cells. When released, they signal the immune system to do its job. Cytokines affect the growth
        of all blood cells and other cells that help the body's immune and inflammation responses
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Interleukins (IL):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        These are a type of cytokine first thought to be expressed by leukocytes alone but have later
        been
        found to be produced by many other body cells. They play essential roles in the activation and differentiation
        of immune cells, as well as proliferation, maturation, migration, and adhesion.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Monoclonal antibodies:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        These are laboratory-produced molecules engineered to serve as substitute antibodies that
        can
        restore, enhance, modify or mimic the immune system's attack on cells that aren't wanted, such as cancer cells.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Erythropoietin (EPO):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        It is a type of protein called a growth factor. It is used to treat a low
        number of red blood cells (anaemia) due to cancer or its treatment.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Plasminogen:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        It is a protein that acts like a "cleanup crew" in your blood, breaking down clots once they're no
        longer needed to keep your blood flowing smoothly.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Thalassemia:</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        It is an inherited (i.e., passed from parents to children through genes) blood disorder caused when
        the
        body doesn't make enough of a protein called hemoglobin, an important part of red blood cells.
    </h2>

    <br>

    <h1 class="heading">Adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA deficiency):</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">
        It is a metabolic disorder that causes
        immunodeficiency. It is
        caused by mutations in the ADA gene.
