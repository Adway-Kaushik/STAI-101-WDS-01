    <h1 class="heading">What is a GMO?</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are living things like plants, animals, or tiny organisms
        that have been changed in a way that doesn't happen naturally through breeding or mixing genes. This is done
        using genetic engineering which involves altering their DNA, the genetic instructions that make them who they
        are.
    </h2>
    <h1 class="heading">Advantages of Gentically Modified Organisms</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">Classical breeding and GM crops differ in altering genes. GM brings targeted changes, while
        breeding mixes genes randomly. GM ensures specific outcomes, unlike breeding's potential issues. GM's precise
        control avoids unsafe genes, unlike breeding. For instance, traditional potato breeding can yield toxic
        substances. GM achieves precise gene changes and new traits without extensive cross-breeding, yet both genetic
        modification and classical breeding have similar impact on the environment.
    </h2>
    <h1 class="heading">How does genetic modification occur?</h1>
    <h2 class="subwrite">Creating a genetically modified (GM) crop involves multiple steps, starting with identifying
        the target gene. This gene is chosen based on its specific trait, like drought tolerance, and can be from the
        same or a related plant species. Once identified, the gene is cloned and inserted into a construct with a
        promoter and terminator, then transferred into bacterial <a href="important-terms.html"
            title="A plasmid is a small circular DNA molecule found in bacteria and some other microscopic organisms. Plasmids are physically separate from chromosomal DNA and replicate independently.">plasmids</a>
        for duplication. The DNA construct is
        introduced into plant cells through methods like Agrobacterium or gene gun.
        Only transformed plant cells, identified by traits like antibiotic resistance, survive and are regenerated into
        whole plants. Genetic analyses are done to ensure the correct insertion and functioning of the target gene,
        avoiding unintended changes. The transformed plants undergo risk assessments for environmental and health
        impacts before being introduced to the field.
