      <marquee scrollamount="12" direction="left" id="mymarquee">Genetic engineering is a
        process
        that
        uses laboratory-based technologies to
        alter the DNA makeup of an organism.</marquee>
    </h2>
    <h2 class="subwrite">Genetic engineering refers to a sophisticated scientific technique for precisely altering an
      organism's inherited characteristics through the manipulation of its genetic material. This intricate process
      involves the introduction of external genes, acquired from either the same species or across species boundaries,
      as well as the modification of existing genes. These genetic manipulations are orchestrated using recombinant DNA
      methods or artificial DNA synthesis, allowing scientists to reconfigure the organism's genetic code.
    </h2>
    <br>
    <h2 class="subwrite">The consequences of genetic engineering can be felt across diverse domains including scientific
      research, medical applications, agriculture, and industrial processes. This innovation has yielded pivotal medical
      breakthroughs, exemplified by the synthesis of vital substances like human insulin and vaccines, thus mitigating
      serious health conditions. Additionally, it has facilitated the creation of genetically modified organisms that
      exhibit improved attributes, such as improved resistance to diseases in plants. However, the ethical, ecological,
      and safety dimensions of genetic engineering have caused significant discussions. The deliberate modification of
      an organism's genetic composition prompts considerations about unintended repercussions and the ethical
      implications of tampering with nature. Hence, while genetic engineering offers remarkable potential, its sensible
      and responsible implementation mandates a comprehensive assessment of its advantages and potential pitfalls.
